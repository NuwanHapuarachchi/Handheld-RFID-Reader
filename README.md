|-----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Operating Frequency** | 13.56 | MHz | HF RFID frequency |
| **Target Impedance** | 20 | Œ© | Antenna impedance |
| **Antenna Dimensions** | 65 x 65 | mm | Physical size |
| **Number of Turns (N)** | 2 | - | Antenna coil turns |
| **Track Width (w)** | 500 | ¬µm | PCB trace width |
| **Gap between tracks (g)** | 500 | ¬µm | Spacing between traces |
| **Simulated Inductance** | 891 | nH | Calculated inductance |
| **Simulated Capacitance** | 2.3 | pF | Calculated capacitance |
| **Simulated Resistance** | 1.180 | Œ© | Calculated resistance |

## üè† Enclosure Design

The enclosure and charging cradle were designed in **SolidWorks** for ergonomics, durability, and ease of assembly. The final models were 3D printed using ABS material.

### Design Features
- **Ergonomic gun-shaped design** for comfortable handheld operation
- **Robust ABS construction** for industrial durability
- **Integrated charging cradle** for convenient storage and charging
- **Professional finish** suitable for commercial applications
